Introduction and Chapter 2
Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)
Raw data is data that is not "cooked", in other words, not be sorted by some specific mechanisms or be analyzed. It could be a very bad idea since it is in disorder and basically just a bunch of chaos without patterns. But also because it is not processed in any kind of way, it could reveal the reality in the most accurate possible way. People need to spend a considerable amount of time and energy into them in order to learn something from the "raw data". And when people are trying to interpret them or analyzing them, biases and subjective opinions could take place. So here lies the paradox, which, according to Bowker, describes as "both an oxymoron and a bad idea".

Section 1 (pp. 665)
What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.
Accouting tools could shape the reality they measure by the way the measure it. Big data researchers could also shape the reality they represent by the way the data is collected. By appearances we would simply assume that those accounting tools or search engines would aid the corresponding economic activity or research, but how they shape the reality they represents is almost invisible and very hard to notice.

Section 3 and 4 (pp. 668)
In which way is Twitter data limited?
Twitter data is limited because of the limitation of Twitter users. A great amount of people don’t use Twitter, and for those who do, some of them don’t tweet to express their opinions at all, some of them have multiple accounts, some of them are bots, some of them are manipulated by large companies to produce soft-advertising tweets. Equaling “users” to “people” is a very bad idea. As the data does not have a good variety of sources, the data could not be very reliable.

Section 5 (pp. 671)
If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.
Personally I don’t agree with this idea. Just because you don’t need to log in to obtain certain data, does not mean that the data is free to use. These data may be open to public because anybody has access to them without logging in. But they are not allowed to be “free to use” under any circumstances. People share a considerable amount of information on social media platforms, from their interests to opinions. These information could be displayed on the platforms and shared by everyone who could see it, but using it out of whatever reasons should get permission both from the users and the platform. However, in today’s situation, our information has been used in so many ways with us unconscious about it. It is not only unethical, but also illicit. But when using social media, no one really looks into the over-ten-pages privacy agreement, so when cases like this happen, it’s gonna be the users who take the consequences.

No prompts here, but a very well written chapter that is relevant to everything we will be talking about this semester. Please enjoy.
okay!
