1. "Schmidt's - and Google's - worldview is one that is entirely predicated on the belief that making something visible makes it better,and that technology is the tool to make things visible. This view, which has come to dominate the world, is not only fundamentally wrong; it is actively dangerous, both globally and in the specific instance that Schmidt states."

I find this extremly interesting because the author thinks that making something visible does not necessarily makes something better, and in fact dangerous. But the development on human civilization is all based on the push from the invisible who want to make themselves visible. All the revolutions in this world, are all done by people who tried to make themselves heard and seen. So making things visible, it may not necessarily make things better, but i don't think it is "fundamentally wrong adn actively dangerous".

2. "The phrase 'data is the new oil' was apparently coined in 2006 by Clive Humby, the British mathematician and architect of the Tesco Clubcard, a supermaker reward programme. Since then, it has been repeated and amplified, first by marketers, then by entrepreneurs, and ultimatedly by business leaders and policy makers."

This passage points out that this concept is repeated and amplified by the marketers, which I couldn't agree more. The so-called information age is purly defined by people who want to make profits out of the over-floating data. We could not necessarily define whether data is evil or not, but the idea of 'data is the new oil' is something purly planted into our brain by the marketers.

3. "While peak knowledge may be closer than we think, the exploitation of raw information can continue infinitely, along with the damage it does to us and our ability to reckon with the world"

I love the word that the author uses here: "exploitation of raw information". He considers that the process of analying information as an act of exploitation. And this is what we have been doing over the semester. I don't think what we have been doing is wrong, but I could not say he is wrong either.
